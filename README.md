## Description

The aim of this project is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a business day by modifying using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This has taught me how to implement jQuery (specifically moment.js) and bootstrap in my everyday website development to reduce the amount of code I need to write.

## Technologies used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery) and Bootstrap

## Usage

The current date and time is displayed on the screen, along with 'timeblocks' from 8am-6pm. Users can press on a timeblock and enter their tasks. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red) or future (green). All user input is saved into local storage for the user, so that each saved event persists when the user revisits the app. The user can also mark tasks as complete in the timeblock which will turn the check mark to green.
