## Description

The aim of this project is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a business day by modifying using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This has taught me how to implement jQuery (specifically moment.js) and bootstrap in my everyday website development to reduce the amount of code I need to write.

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 
- jQuery
- Moment.js 

## Usage

The current date and time is displayed on the screen, along with 'timeblocks' from 9am-5pm. Users can press on a timeblock and enter their tasks. Each timeblock is colour coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (green) or future (red). The user can click on their desired timeblock, input their task and then press the save button. This will store the task into local storage, meaning each saved event persists when the user revisits the page. The user is also able to clear their day planner by pressing the "clear all" button at the top of the page.
